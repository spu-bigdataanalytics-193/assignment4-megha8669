In this assignment, I worked with same database as last assignment but now i am using spark. 
There are some ways to using spark like Dockers, Databricks and Google Colab. 
I was trying to do map reduce with Dockers and Databricks but it was showing some error so I couldn't have done with those spark tools. Finally, i get result using Google Colab. So i have done my assignment with Google Colab.

-> Using Google Colab,

I was starting with install java lib and spark then connect with mount google drive. Here, I am using PYSPRK library to get the proper result and i just load the data because i already downloaded the data in last assignment. 
I use the map reduce algorithm(Mapping, Shuffling, Reducing) to have the number of flights by carrier.
